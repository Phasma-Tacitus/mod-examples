## Cortex Reaver Challenge

This is an archive-only-mod, to be started as a new game.

### Synopsis

The player starts in a big room, with a Laser Rapier, targeting hardware and a shield hardware placed in front of them,
and they have to fight an endless stream of Cortex Reavers. Energy charge stations are in the four corners, and players must be careful
which ones they use.

How many reavers can you slay? There is no restoration chamber...
