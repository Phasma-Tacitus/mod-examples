## Empty Localized files

This folder contains empty audio resources, which can be used as a basis for a new content mod.

> Although the string and mfd-art resources also contain localized data, these are small files by default and their content can easily be modified with the tools.

### Installation Instructions

Copy the ```*.res``` files over the original file in the directory of the resources.

### Requirements

* Any release version of System Shock 1

### Technical Details

The resource files were created using ```construct``` with the following command:
```
construct resource
```
The created ```empty.res``` was then copied several times.
