# InkyBlackness MOD examples for original System Shock 1

This is a sub-project as part of the [InkyBlackness](https://inkyblackness.github.io) project.
It contains modding examples for the original video game [System Shock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock).

Examples in this repository showcase various possibilities of the game engine and/or act as tutorials for creating larger mods.

Each subdirectory in this repository is a separate example. As a general rule, mods will require you to replace
some of the original resource files of the game. Be sure to work with backup copies to avoid breaking the main game.
