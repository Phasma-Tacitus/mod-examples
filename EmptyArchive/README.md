### Installation Instructions

### Technical Details

This archive was created using ```construct``` with the following command:
```
construct --solid --levels rrrrrrrrrrcrrrcc
```

* Levels 10, 14, and 15 are cyberspace.
* All other 13 levels are real-world levels.
* All tiles are solid, with the exception of the starting tile (at 30:22) in level 1.
